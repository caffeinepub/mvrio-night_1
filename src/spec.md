# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Home channel banner area larger without cropping/stretching the banner image, and add a neon-green “THE MVRIO” text overlay on the right side of the banner.

**Planned changes:**
- Increase the Home channel banner container’s width/height so it appears noticeably larger on mobile and desktop while keeping the banner image fully visible (no cropping, no stretching).
- Add a responsive overlay text label “THE MVRIO” positioned in the banner’s right-side region, styled in neon green (#1ED760) and kept readable.
- Adjust banner layout/spacing so the overlay and the existing banner edit controls (upload/link/clear) do not overlap and remain clickable, with no collisions with the header, A2HS banner, or content below.

**User-visible outcome:** The Home banner displays in a larger area across screen sizes with the full image always visible, and the artist name “THE MVRIO” appears on top of the banner on the right in neon green without interfering with controls.

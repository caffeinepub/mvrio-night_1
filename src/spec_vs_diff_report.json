  "summary": "Diff implements core auth-state derivation from Internet Identity in AuthContext, updates multiple restricted-action entry points to use isAuthenticated/requireAuth plus sign-in-required error detection, and improves the SignInModal login button behavior. However, the pending-action retry/clear flow (REQ-202) is not fully verifiable from the truncated diff, and coverage across all restricted actions listed in REQ-199 cannot be confirmed from the provided modified files.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-199",
      "requirement": "Fix the global auth state so the app correctly treats an Internet Identity signed-in user as authenticated for all restricted actions (Like, Add to Favorites, Create Playlist, Add to Playlist, offline cache, device download, messaging), preventing the soft sign-in modal from appearing when the sidebar already shows the user is logged in.",
      "reason": "The diff shows updates for favorites/playlists/offline-cache in specific components, but does not provide evidence that all listed restricted actions (notably messaging and device download, and any other entry points for like/favorites outside SongOverflowMenu) are covered. With only a subset of files shown/modified, full app-wide coverage cannot be confirmed.",

      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-202",
      "requirement": "Ensure pending restricted actions complete correctly after successful authentication: after sign-in succeeds the app retries the pending action once and then clears pending state so the modal does not reappear for subsequent actions.",
      "reason": "usePendingAction introduces a hasExecuted guard and executes actions after loginStatus === 'success', but the provided diff is truncated at the end of the try/catch/finally and does not show a definitive call to clearPendingAction (or other logic) that reliably clears pending state after execution.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/hooks/usePendingAction.ts (truncated, ends at `} finally` without showing pending-action clearing)"

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added playlist deletion capabilities (new delete playlist React Query hooks and UI confirmation flow).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on fixing sign-in state mismatch and soft sign-in modal behavior for restricted actions; it does not request adding playlist deletion features.",

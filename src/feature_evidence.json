      "featureTitle": "Implement an additional Hidden Admin Mode activation method: a press-and-hold (long-press) gesture on the Home channel banner image area that, after a continuous 5 seconds, opens the existing Admin passcode modal (the same modal used by the Ctrl+Shift+U shortcut) so the admin can enter the existing passcode and enable Admin Mode. This long-press trigger must work on both mobile (touch) and desktop (mouse/pointer), must not replace or modify the existing Ctrl+Shift+U shortcut behavior, and must not interfere with normal song playback/navigation interactions elsewhere on the Home screen.",

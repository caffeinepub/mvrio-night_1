  "summary": "Project scope update: enhance the “Send a Message” in-app messaging so users message the admin identity “MARIO” (replies display MARIO as sender, and MARIO’s avatar uses the current Home channel banner image). Admin online status is displayed Instagram-style (green dot + “online” when Hidden Admin Mode is ON; gray dot + “offline” when Hidden Admin Mode is OFF). Implement message seen/read receipts for both sides and ensure unread notification dots clear after messages are seen. Maintain a single per-user conversation thread (Normal Message + Custom Song Request via a fillable form + optional free-text) and remove any separate admin inbox UI view while still allowing the admin (when Hidden Admin Mode is ON) to see the list of all user conversations and reply within the same thread. Add file attachments to messages (images, MP3s, PDFs). Keep user hard-deletion of their own messages; allow MARIO (Hidden Admin Mode) to delete any messages (user or admin) and delete entire conversations via a delete icon on each user conversation card. Additionally, update auth/account so first launch requires Internet Identity login + required profile completion (full name, username, date of birth) and show this under a new “Account” sidebar area along with total listening time aggregated across songs played. Hidden Admin Mode activation must support BOTH Ctrl+Shift+U and a 5-second long-press on the Home banner image (especially for mobile), using the same passcode + backend verification flow. In conversation threads, display the user’s chosen username as the user identity label.",
